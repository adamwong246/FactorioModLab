# Recursive Science

This mod makes science much harder.

- Science packs now require lower tiers of science packs as ingredients.
- Labs come in tiers. Each tier unlocks more numbers of inputs.
- Each tier of lab is slightly faster but more energy intensive and create more pollution.
- Each tier of lab require previous tiers of labs and their science packs as ingredients!
- Labs are immovable!
